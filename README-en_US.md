## Introduce

AnQiCMS is a high-performance content management system developed using the Go programming language. It supports multi-site and multilingual management, offering flexible content publishing and template management capabilities. The system is equipped with rich SEO-friendly features, including custom fields, document categorization, and batch import/export, making it an ideal choice for building websites.

AnQiCMS aims to provide small and medium-sized enterprises with an efficient, stable, and flexible content management platform, particularly catering to businesses and individual users requiring high security, cross-site and multilingual support, and large-scale data management. Leveraging the high-performance advantages of the Go language, AnQiCMS not only meets basic content management needs but also addresses core issues such as website security, high performance, multi-site management, and multilingual support through ongoing feature expansion and performance optimization.

Traditional CMS systems face numerous challenges, including recurring legal disputes that pose potential risks to businesses. Additionally, traditional CMS solutions struggle with handling large volumes of article data, often resulting in high server resource consumption and slow page loading, with limited improvement through conventional optimization methods. Furthermore, PHP-based CMS systems are prone to security vulnerabilities, such as website defacement and hacking incidents. This has driven us to break free from the limitations of PHP and develop a more secure, flexible, and stable content management system using the Go programming language.

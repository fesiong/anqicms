## Introduce

The predecessor of AnQi Content Management System (AnQiCMS) is GoBlog, a simple personal blog system based on the iris framework and developed using golang

> GoBlog is an open source personal blog system written in golang, with an elegant interface, compact, fast execution speed, and SEO-friendly, which can meet daily blog needs. It is very simple to use and deploy, and is adaptive to PC and mobile terminals.
